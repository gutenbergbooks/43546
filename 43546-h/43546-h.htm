<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the thousands of little American cousins
the little Scotch cousins send their greetings.</p>

<p>The Scotch, perhaps, are not so very different
from the Americans, after all, and certainly
there is so much in common between the English,
the Americans, and the Scotch that each
may be expected to have a lively concern in
the affairs of the other!</p>

<p>Many of the Scottish legends and stories
of romance and history have an abounding
interest for Americans of all ages, and who
shall say that Scott and Burns are not as great
favourites in America as in Scotland itself?
For this reason, and for the fact that thousands
of Scottish-Americans have never severed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the ties of sentiment which bind them to
Bonnie Scotland, a warm welcome is assured
to our little Scotch cousins whenever they
may come to visit America.</p>

<p>As with our little English cousins there is
the bond of common speech; and Scotch
institutions, though varied and strange in
many instances, are in others very similar to
those of America.</p>

<p>Of the historic and scenic charms of Scotland
much has already been written in the
romances and poems of Scott and Burns, so
that little American cousins may be expected
to have at least a nodding acquaintance with
them. On the other hand, these charms are
so numerous and varied that American cousins
cannot but wish that some day they may be
able to visit the land of purple heather.</p>

<h2>Our Little Scotch Cousin</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FINDING OF "ROB ROY"</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hello!</span> Sandy, what do you think I have
got here?" called Donald, over the low wall
which separated his garden from that of his
chum. He was quite excited, so Sandy knew
that something out of the ordinary had happened,
and quickly leaped over the wall. He
found Donald carefully holding his muffler,
which was wriggling about in the most extraordinary
manner.</p>

<p>"What on earth is it,&mdash;a rat?" asked
Sandy, looking curiously at the muffler, which
seemed trying to tie itself up in a hard knot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"A rat!" exclaimed Donald, with great
scorn.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose, Sandy MacPherson, that
I'd be carrying a rat around like this? But
you couldn't guess if you tried all day; look
here."</p>

<p>He carefully undid one end of the muffler,
and out wriggled a little brown head.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a finer pup than that?"
and Donald, with great pride, showed a little
puppy, who was trying to chew up his
fingers.</p>

<p>"My! but he's a bonnie one; who gave
him to you, Don?"</p>

<p>"I found him," and Donald went on
eagerly to tell the story. "You know that
lane which leads to the widow Calden's
house? Well, I came through there to-day,
thinking I might catch Andy and Archie
playing marbles. You know we thought
they had been trying to dodge us lately. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
at once I felt something tugging at my
shoe, and there was the pup. I looked
around for its mother, but there was no sign
of any other dog about. The poor, wee bairn
whined, and was so glad when I picked him up,
I could not leave him there alone, could I?"
Donald explained, in self-defence. "You can
see he hasn't had his eyes open very long,
and he might have starved to death; so I
wrapped him up in my muffler, as he was
all of a shiver from the cold. Then I ran
to the widow Calden, but she did not know
any pup like it in the neighbourhood. The
baker's boy drove up just then in his cart, but
he did not know any one who had a dog with
a young pup, so I brought him home."</p>

<p>"But you can't keep him," said Sandy;
"he must belong to some one."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they wanted to get rid of him,"
said Donald, hopefully. "I am going to show
him to father, and he will know what to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
about it. Perhaps he may advertise him in
the paper, and then if no one claims him he
will belong to me."</p>

<p>The two lads ran across the garden and
burst into the sitting-room where Doctor
Gordon and Mrs. Gordon were having afternoon
tea.</p>

<p>"Well, laddies," called out the doctor, cheerfully,
"you do not often neglect your tea like
this. Hey! what is all this about?" he continued,
as his son poured out his story.</p>

<p>"Poor, wee doggie," said the doctor, petting
the pup, who licked his hand and wobbled
all over with delight, "and a fine collie
pup he is, too; he comes of a good breed,
if I am not mistaken."</p>

<p>"Oh! then I shall have a fine dog when
he grows up, father," cried Donald, with joy.</p>

<p>"Gently, my son," said his father. "We
must find out his owner if we can. A valuable
puppy like that will be missed, and if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
advertise him the notice will probably be seen
by the right person. We must also give
notice at the police station."</p>

<p>"But if no one claims him I can keep him,
can't I?" pleaded Don, who had grown dismal
at the thought that he might be deprived of
his new pet.</p>

<p>"Surely," said the doctor, "we could not
refuse to give him a good home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon had meanwhile poured out
a saucer of milk, and, warming it a little,
placed it in front of doggie. It was the
funniest thing to see him. First he dashed
into the middle of the saucer, and stuck his
little nose deep in the milk; then such a
sneezing and choking followed. Finally, he
found that it tasted good, and that it was for
his mouth, and not for his paws, and he
lapped away in earnest, while everybody knelt
on the floor and watched him.</p>

<p>"He may stay in the armchair by the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
until I can find a basket for him to sleep in,"
said Mrs. Gordon, returning to the tea-table.</p>

<p>The boys were soon there as well, for the
tea at half-past four in the afternoon is the
favourite meal of the four which the Scotch
usually eat during the day.</p>

<p>There are such good things to eat then!
First, there is shortbread, a sort of crisp cake,
made with a great deal of sugar and butter,
and very little flour, which melts away in your
mouth. Then there are hot buttered scones,
which, if you know anything at all about Scotland,
you must have heard of, for they are one
of their best-liked dishes; and until you have
eaten a scone, well-buttered, you will have no
idea how good they are.</p>

<p>Cakes, too; "layer cake," with chocolate
between the layers; and nice little round
cakes, fluted around the edge,&mdash;all children
know that pattern,&mdash;hot from the oven, for
Mrs. Gordon made her own cake and shortbread.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Indeed, Scotch women consider it
quite an accomplishment to make their own
shortbread, which is far nicer than that which
is bought outside.</p>

<p>Then there is jam and preserved ginger.
Perhaps you did not know that Scotch people
were very fond of sweet things. They are,
indeed, and they make many different kinds,
and they are all good.</p>

<p>Of course the talk around the table was all
about the little puppy.</p>

<p>"Oh, father!" suddenly said Donald, with
his mouth full of shortbread, "I can train him
to be a sheep-dog, can't I? And we will take
care of the sheep, like the herds and collies
that Uncle Alan was telling us about."</p>

<p>"You are ambitious, my son," laughed the
doctor. "You must get your uncle to tell
you some of the wonderful feats performed
by the sheep-dogs and their masters, and the
difficult work that they have to do, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
you will not think it so easy to turn yourself
and the little doggie into shepherds. And
that reminds me that I had a letter from your
uncle to-day, and he wants us to make him
a visit next month, in time for Marjorie's
birthday-party. 'We must have a meeting
of the Clans,' he says, 'to celebrate the day.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, how jolly!" cried Donald, prancing
about the room, and waving his napkin.
"Uncle Alan's the best thing that ever
lived; he lets you do just what you want
when you go to see him."</p>

<p>"He has invited Sandy, also; but I must
warn him," said the doctor, trying to look
severe, and shaking a finger at the boys, "that
you laddies are not to do everything that you
wish, such as wheedling old Dugald into letting
you carry the guns, as happened once
before when your uncle and I went shooting."</p>

<p>The doctor's effort to be stern did not last
long, for Donald nearly choked him with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
big hug, and then subsided panting beside
Sandy. Whenever Sandy was very much
pleased he grew speechless and shy, but he
nudged Don with his elbow and grinned, so
every one knew he was as delighted as the
more talkative Don.</p>

<p>"But that is not all the news," said Mrs.
Gordon. "Your cousins are coming to make
us a visit first, and your Uncle Alan says we
may look for them next week."</p>

<p>"Hurrah! won't we have fun going about
seeing things," and Don started another dance,
for he was very fond of his two little cousins,
Janet and Marjorie Lindsay, and thought
them far nicer than most lassies, for they
could keep up with him on a day's climb
over the moors, and play games almost as
well as Sandy.</p>

<p>The boys were soon whispering together
in a corner, and planning how much pleasure
they could crowd into this wonderful week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Don told for the hundredth time of the
marvels of Skylemore, his Uncle Alan's
beautiful home in the Highlands.</p>

<p>Uncle Alan Lindsay was a very wonderful
person to Donald. He had gone to America
when he was a young lad, and had made a
great fortune in copper mines. He wanted to
enjoy it in Scotland, his own country, however,
for the Scotch are very clannish, and
like nothing better than to be in their own
land, and among their own people.</p>

<p>So he came back to Scotland, and bought
a fine estate with a beautiful house, into which
he put handsome furniture and good pictures
and books,&mdash;everything that could make a
home attractive. To Donald it seemed a palace,
and he did not think the king himself had
anything so grand.</p>

<p>Around the house was a big park, with
miles of rolling woodland well stocked with
deer. Here one could shoot grouse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
pheasants and small game of all kinds. There
were several clear streams and a <i>loch</i>, as a lake
is called in Scotland, where one could fish for
salmon and trout, and catch them, too, if one
only knew how.</p>

<p>Many were the stories that Don had told
Sandy of his adventures in company with old
Dugald, the gamekeeper, who had taught him
how to fish; and how together they had
tramped miles over the wild moors covered
with heather.</p>

<p>Donald never tired of hearing his uncle tell
of his life and adventures in the far-away Western
States of America, which seemed always to
him to belong to another world. The story
of how he had lived among real Indians, and
had been lost in great snow-storms, was like
a recounting of adventures of the olden time
to the lad.</p>

<p>Donald was amazed, too, at the tales of the
great cities that his uncle had seen in America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
with big buildings so tall that they seemed
like many houses piled one on top of another.
Then again there were miles and miles of
nothing but great wheat-fields. "Why, you
could drop Scotland down in the midst of
them and it would be so small that you would
not be able to find it again if it were not for
the mountains sticking up above the grain,"
Uncle Alan would say, with a twinkle in his
eye. But he would always add: "It's a grand
country, bonnie Scotland, if it is a wee one,
my lad."</p>

<p>For many days after he had found the
puppy, Donald would rush home from school,
not even stopping where the enticing rattle
told him that a game of "boules" was going
on. His heart would be in his mouth when
he reached the gate of Kelvin House, as the
Gordons' home in Edinburgh was called, for
he was afraid that the doggie would be gone.
But as day after day passed, and no one came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to say that they had lost a little dog, Donald
breathed easier, and the little puppy was
looked upon as one of the Gordon family.
Finally, even the doctor said it was time to
give "doggie" a name.</p>

<p>The whole family talked the matter over
a long time, but it was Don who finally
decided to name him after the hero of his
favourite story, "Rob Roy," written by the
great Scotch author, Sir Walter Scott, which
his father was even then reading aloud to him
evenings.</p>

<p>The puppy's name was in time shortened
to Rob. He loved the whole family, beginning
with the doctor and ending with the
stable-boy; but he adored Donald, and
whined most dolefully each morning when
he left him, and barked and wriggled about
like an eel, with pleasure, when Donald came
back again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SCHOOL-DAYS AND HOLIDAYS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Here</span> is good news for you, laddie.
Whom do you think we shall have with us
for the New Year?" said Doctor Gordon,
looking up from a letter he was reading, as
Don came into the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>"Oh, father!" cried Donald, trying to
reach the letter, as the doctor held it high
above his head, "it's from Uncle Clarke, I
know. When is he coming? and won't we
have a good time?" he said, all in one breath,
as he tried to dance a Highland fling about
the room.</p>

<p>"Now, if you will sit down to your porridge,
perhaps I can read it to you."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he write to me, too?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Don, as he took his place at the table, for
next to his father and mother Don thought
there was no one he cared more for than this
uncle. He was a younger brother of Doctor
Gordon's, and also a doctor. Just now he
was in Paris, taking a special course at the
University there, and he wrote to tell them
that he had been offered a post in one of the
government stations for the study of tropical
diseases, but that he would spend some weeks
with them before taking up his new duties.</p>

<p>Don put down his spoon in dismay. "I
wish he didn't know anything about nasty
old microbes, if he is going way off there,"
he said, half-crying, "I think he might stay
here in Scotland like you, father."</p>

<p>"There, there, you must not mind, dear;
this is the chance your uncle has always wished
for. It is a distinction, too, for a young man
like him to be offered this position; and when
he comes to see us, think how much that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
new and strange he will be able to tell you,"
said Mrs. Gordon.</p>

<p>"All about lions and elephants?" questioned
Don, his spirits rising.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said his father, laughingly;
"only I don't know that he will hunt big
game like that in his profession; but he will
tell you all about it when he comes."</p>

<p>"And he will be here for 'Hogmanay;'
won't we have the fun?" said Don, making
his porridge-bowl dance a jig this time.</p>

<p>"Hurry, dear, or you will be late for
school," said his mother, and Don dived
again into his porridge, which American cousins
call oatmeal.</p>

<p>All well-trained Scotch children eat porridge
for their breakfast, though it is going a little
out of fashion these days. But Don ate it
each morning, served in an old porridge-bowl
which his father used when he was a lad.
Around the rim of this rare old bowl was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
inscription, "There's mair in the kitchen,"
"mair" being the old Scotch word for more.</p>

<p>You must know porridge is a good thing
to begin the day on in winter in Scotland.
Donald was eating his breakfast by gaslight,
even though it was eight o'clock, while in mid-winter
it does not grow really light until ten
in the morning, and is dark again soon after
three in the afternoon. In summer, things
are turned around, and the light of day lingers
well on into the night, and begins again at an
astonishingly early hour in the morning. You
may read out-of-doors very often, in the northern
cities and towns, at eleven o'clock at night.
All this is because Scotland is so far north, but
some day you will understand more about this
strange thing.</p>

<p>There were other things for breakfast besides
porridge. Eggs and bacon and fish and nice
brown toast, and sometimes toasted cheese on
bread, which seems a funny thing to have for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
breakfast; and always plenty of marmalade,
for the best marmalade is made in Scotland.</p>

<p>It is said that the word marmalade comes
from the word "marmalada," which is a jam
made in Portugal from the quince, which fruit
the Portuguese call the marmello. The Portuguese
think it strange that the Scotch make
their marmalade from oranges.</p>

<p>"There is Sandy calling to you at the gate,"
said Mrs. Gordon, and Don, hastily swallowing
his last bit of toast and picking up his
strap full of school-books, joined him at
once.</p>

<p>The two lads ran up the street quickly, for
school began at nine o'clock, and they were
already behind their usual time. At the
corner Don turned and waved his hand to
his mother. He never forgot to do this, for
he knew that she was always waiting there to
bid him good-bye. Though Donald was the
only child, he was not a bit spoiled; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a warm-hearted laddie, and staunch in his
affections and friendships.</p>

<p>The schools and colleges in Scotland are
among the best in the world, and there is
nothing a Scotsman prizes more, whether he
be rich or poor, than a good education. Many
a lad who has not enough money will go
through all sorts of hardship, and live on a
little porridge and milk, in order to save
enough to put him through one of the four
famous Scotch Universities.</p>

<p>All little American cousins must have heard
of the wealthy Scotsman, Mr. Carnegie, who
is so fond of making presents of libraries to
the cities and towns throughout the English-speaking
world. Well, he has greatly helped
the Scotch boys to get an education by giving
large sums of money to the Universities of
Scotland, in order that they may be able to
lend substantial aid to those entering their
colleges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's play 'beezee;' there's Willie and
Archie now with the ball," said Sandy, as he
and Don came out of school for the half-hour's
recess at eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>"Beezee" is a game which would remind
American boys of baseball. The boys wrap
their mufflers around their hand and throw
the ball, which is an India-rubber one, instead
of using a bat, and run to bases in much the
same way as in baseball.</p>

<p>At two o'clock, when the school work is
over for the day, Donald and Sandy lost no
time in getting home for dinner, which was
awaiting them. And so was "Rob Roy,"
who soon learned just what hour Donald
might be expected, and rushed to meet him
the minute Don opened the door.</p>

<p>To-day, when Don had finished his soup,
his father helped him to some of the "jiggot."
You probably wonder what that is. Well, it
is simply a leg of mutton, and comes from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
French word "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gigot</i>." You will find that the
Scotch use many words which must have come
originally from the French, though most of
them have been changed so much that the real
French words wouldn't know them for cousins
even.</p>

<p>In the old days there was a strong friendship
between Scotland and France. One of
the early French kings, Louis XI., had a
body-guard of Scottish archers; for the Scotch
soldiery have always been famous for their
bravery. Mary, Queen of Scots, was partly
French herself, and was the wife of a French
king, François II., as well as Queen of Scotland.
When he died she came back to
Scotland to live, and with her, no doubt,
came many French people and French customs.
So this may account for many of
these French words in the Scotch speech
of to-day.</p>

<p>Don called his napkin a "serviette," which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
is just the same as in French; and was very
fond of eating "petticoat-tails" at tea-time,&mdash;a
name which you would never imagine came
from the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits-gateaux</i>" of the French, meaning
"little cakes."</p>

<p>Also he would get very "fash," which
means angry,&mdash;or "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fâché</i>," our little French
cousin would say,&mdash;if a boy struck him a
"coochard's" blow; that is, a cowardly blow.
This word, too, seems likely enough to be
French, and to come from "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i>," meaning
a blow, though where the coward comes in,
it is difficult to see.</p>

<p>If Donald, while playing a game, found
things growing too hot for him, and wanted
a breathing-spell, he often would call out,
"barley." He did not mean that he wanted
barley at all, but to parley, which is the way
the Scotch have changed the French word
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parlez</i>"&mdash;speak.</p>

<p>Afternoons Donald and Sandy generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
spent together, and very good times they
had, too, for they were very "chief," or
chummy. They played games with their
little neighbours, or took long walks into
the country, which could be easily reached
from Kelvin House. Often they went fishing.
At other times, Sandy's chickens took
up some of their spare hours. Sandy had
an idea that he could make a lot of money
raising chickens; so he talked it all over
with his father, who was much amused, but
gave him the money to buy his first chickens.
Then Sandy himself built a little house
for them in the back-garden, and fenced off
a piece of ground for his three hens and one
cock, and even got his mother to subscribe for
a paper which told all about "Poultry for
Beginners."</p>

<p>All Sandy had to show for his summer's
work, however, was one little "tewky," which
is the Scotch cousin's name for a chicken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Sandy was very proud of his one little
chicken, and made quite a pet of it. It
would eat out of his hand, and even from
his mouth, and would go anywhere with
Sandy, perched upon his shoulder.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/i043.jpg" width="336" height="500" alt="Woman a waterfront holding basket of fish" />
<div class="caption">A NEWHAVEN FISHWIFE.</div>
</div>

<p>But the best holiday for Donald and Sandy
was when their fathers would take them to the
beautiful golf-links along the seashore at Gullane,
not far from Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Golf is the great national game of Scotland,
and is played both by old folk and young
people alike. Some one tells the story that
it was first played by the shepherds, who
would take a small round stone and knock
it about with their sticks, as they strolled
behind their flocks, over the moors and along
the seashore. All any one really knows about
the game, however, is that it has been played
in Scotland for a very long time.</p>

<p>Once, as a very great treat, Donald's father
took him to play golf at St. Andrews, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the links are so fine that they are known the
world over as being the most famous of all
these playgrounds.</p>

<p>There is a saying that the people of St.
Andrews do nothing but play golf, but this
cannot be true, as St. Andrews has one of the
four great Scotch Universities, and many very
great and wise men have come from there;
and you don't get to be a wise man by playing
any kind of a game all of the time.</p>

<p>Another favourite excursion for Edinburgh
children was to go to Newhaven for a fish
dinner. Newhaven is a little old fishing-town
not far distant, on the Firth of Forth.</p>

<p>A Newhaven fishwife, or fisherwoman, looks
funny and dumpy in her short petticoat with
her dress pinned up about her waist, a white
cap on her head, and over all a big shawl;
while on her arm she carries a great basket
of fish.</p>

<p>The fisher-folks' cottages are queer little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
houses built of stone, with a stairway on one
side.</p>

<p>You have already heard what nice things
Donald had to eat at his afternoon tea. Oh!
and there were currant buns, also, just black
with currants. After tea Donald would read,
or, better still, his father or mother would
read aloud some of his favourite stories from
the "Tales of a Grandfather," which tell a
great deal about Scotch history. Between
eight and nine o'clock there would be supper,
of cold meat, cheese, bread and butter, and
sometimes fish, with plenty of milk for Don,
after which he was ready for bed.</p>

<p>Little Scotch children are more careful how
they spend their Sundays than the children
of most other nationalities. The Scotch keep
Sunday, or the Sabbath, as it is usually called,
in a very strict manner indeed, though they
are not as strict in these days as formerly.</p>

<p>When Donald's father was young no trains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
were run on Sundays, and even now there are
no trains in some parts of Scotland on the
Sabbath. In those days children did not even
take a walk on Sunday, but went three times
to "kirk," as church is called. But Donald
often took long walks with his father after
Sunday school in the afternoon. His father
did not, however, approve of their riding in
street-cars, which in the great cities have only
recently begun to run on Sundays, and many
people even now will not make use of them on
that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A WALK IN EDINBURGH</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span> and Marjorie had arrived in Edinburgh,
and one of the first of the pleasures
was a walk around the city to see the sights,
as Don expressed it.</p>

<p>"I know those lads will keep us waiting,"
said Janet, as she pinned on her tam-o'-shanter.</p>

<p>"I think I know where they are; around
the corner playing 'boules,'" answered Marjorie,
as she stood before the mirror, carefully
tying her neck-ribbon. Marjorie was rather
fond of getting herself up as nicely as possible.
She must place her tam at just the right jaunty
angle on her curly yellow hair; her ribbons
must be made into just the proper bows; her
tall boots neatly laced; her gloves and muff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
were always in the right place, and she liked
to have a little posy pinned on to her jacket.
The boys teased her, and called her the "Ladies'
Fashion Page," but you know what boys
are, and after all her little vanities were quite
harmless.</p>

<p>Janet was quite her opposite. She dashed
on her tam without ever stopping to look in
the mirror. Her gloves were more often
rolled up in her pocket than on her hands;
she never could be made to see why one
colour of ribbon was not as good as another,
and always wondered why Marjorie made such
a fuss over her curls and bows. But in spite
of the difference in the two girls they were
devoted chums, and never quite happy unless
they were together.</p>

<p>Janet now stood looking at her sister impatiently.
"Marjorie," she said, "how many
times are you going to tie that bow; we must
hurry up Don and Sandy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I am ready, 'Miss Flurry,'" said
Marjorie, with a final pat to her bow, and the
two little girls ran together into the garden.</p>

<p>"Here they are," said Marjorie, as she
opened a little gate which led into a lane
back of the house, where Donald and Sandy
were playing "boules."</p>

<p>Boules and the button-game, where buttons
are thrown toward a hole scooped out in the
ground next a wall or a fence, in much the
same manner that American boys and girls
play marbles, are favourite games with Scotch
children. Various sorts of buttons are used,
each sort having a different value. A button
from a soldier's coat is worth ten times as
much as an ordinary button, and a coloured
button more than a plain white one. So you
see that loose buttons are very valuable property
with a Scotch boy. Generally he goes
around with his pockets full of them, and
trades them off among his playmates for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
others that he fancies more; and one of the
most acceptable gifts which a boy's mother or
sister or aunt can give him is a long string of
buttons.</p>

<p>"I can do that," declared Marjorie, as she
watched Sandy make several successful shots.</p>

<p>"Lassies never throw straight," said Sandy,
scornfully, flipping another button toward the
hole.</p>

<p>"Marjorie can," said Donald, standing up
for his favourite cousin; "let her try."</p>

<p>"Where are those children?" the doctor was
heard calling, and the young people forgot all
about games, and made a rush for the house.</p>

<p>It was the Saturday holiday, and Doctor
Gordon had promised to take them for a walk
through the old town of Edinburgh. The
doctor enjoyed these walks as much as the
children, for he was very fond of his city, and
took a deep interest in its old buildings and
the famous people who had lived in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor, moreover, had written, in his
spare moments, a valuable book on Edinburgh,
and there was nothing that Donald
enjoyed more than to spend his holidays
tramping with his father through old and
new Edinburgh. Edinburgh, you must know,
was the capital of Scotland in the old days,
and virtually is so to-day, and one of the most
beautiful cities in the world.</p>

<p>Donald knew most of the "sights" of the
town as well as the doctor himself, but to the
lassies all these marvels were much more of
a novelty.</p>

<p>It was a gay little party that got off an
electric car (the Scotch call it "electric," as
do the Americans, and not a "tram," as do
their English cousins just over the border),
Doctor Gordon leading the way, with a niece
on either side of him, and the boys walking
before.</p>

<p>"Let us go to the castle first," said Don,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
who rather thought that he ought to help his
father do the honours.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Marjorie and Janet have
ever seen it really well. You know, father,
you always tell me something new about it
every time we go there," said Donald,
eagerly.</p>

<p>So they crossed Princes Street Gardens,
which divide Edinburgh into the "Old
Town" and the "New Town." The "Old
Town" is on a high hill, and on the highest
part of all is Edinburgh Castle. It was not
long before our party found themselves before
its grand old walls.</p>

<p>"Don, there is your favourite Highland
Regiment coming out of the castle now,"
said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Oh! they are going to drill; can't we
stay and watch them awhile?" cried all the
children, as with one voice.</p>

<p>I know that American children would think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the Scotch regiments the most picturesque soldiers
in the world, in their old-time Highland
costume. Here is a picture of the piper, playing
on the Scotch bagpipes, so you can see for
yourself what a wonderful uniform it is.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/i055.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="man playing pipes; two boys watching" />
<div class="caption">THE HIGHLAND PIPER.</div>
</div>

<p>His kilt and stockings are made of the
tartan which shows the Clan to which he belongs.
In the olden time, each one of the
great families of Scotland banded itself together,
with its followers, into a Clan for
protection, and thus each Clan was really a
little kingdom and army in itself.</p>

<p>The piper's plaid, which is a sort of shawl,
is pinned on his shoulder with a great silver
brooch. In this brooch is set a "cairngorm"
stone, which is the yellow stone called a topaz;
the national stone of Scotland, one might call
it, as it is found there in great quantities.</p>

<p>That funny-looking bag which hangs in
front of him is called a "sporran," and by
his side is a short sword called a "claymore,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and in the olden time there was thrust into
the stocking a dagger called a "skean-dhu."
Would you not think he would be cold, with
his knees bared to the cold east wind which
blows over the castle high up on its rock?
But no such thing ever enters his head, for
Scotch children from infancy are used to going
about with bare knees, winter and summer
alike.</p>

<p>"Isn't the piper splendid, father?" said
Donald, as the squad marched by. "I
should like to be a piper in the Gordon
Highlanders, for that is our regiment; and
their uniform, white with the Gordon tartan,
is the handsomest of all," and Donald tossed
his head with quite an air of pride.</p>

<p>"It's just because you are a Gordon that
you think so," grumbled Sandy. "What's the
matter with the MacPhersons?"</p>

<p>"That's right, laddies, stand up for your
own Clans," said the doctor. "You would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
be a very important man in the regiment if
you were the piper," he continued. "When
the regiment makes a charge on the battlefield
it is the piper who marches in front
playing the national Scottish airs on his pipes.
Nothing inspires the men so much. The
Scotch regiments are the bravest of soldiers,
and their records are among the best in the
world."</p>

<p>"You remember that story father told us,
Marjorie," said Janet, "of the brave piper
who was shot in one leg, and who kept on
playing and marching until he was shot in the
other, so that he could not move either; and
then kept on playing just the same seated on
the ground, with shot and shell falling all
around him, until his regiment drove back
the enemy. He was a brave man," continued
Janet, and tears came into the little
girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"He was indeed a brave man, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
are many like him," said her uncle, "but we
must go on if we are to do everything which
we have planned for to-day," and he led the
way into the old castle, with its massive walls
and dark, winding passages.</p>

<p>Our party viewed the Crown jewels of
Scotland, not so many nor so magnificent as
those of England, but more interesting, perhaps,
for many of the pieces are much older.</p>

<p>The little girls were much interested in the
crown of Robert Bruce, who was one of the
greatest of Scotch kings.</p>

<p>"We have just finished reading 'The Days
of Bruce,'" said Janet, "and that, you know,
tells all about the Scottish king, Robert Bruce,
and his little band of Scotch patriots, who,
after great hardships and sufferings, finally
drove the English invaders out of Scotland."</p>

<p>"They did have a hard time," chimed in
Marjorie, "but still it must have been fun,
living in caves and fixing them up with beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
mosses and flowers, and having brave
knights in splendid armour sing songs to
you." Marjorie was of rather a romantic
turn of mind.</p>

<p>"I'd rather read about the battles, and how
they captured the standards from the enemy,"
said Sandy.</p>

<p>"I like the 'Scottish Chiefs' better," Don
put in, "all about Wallace, who died so gloriously
for his country."</p>

<p>They saw the tiny room, not much larger
than a cupboard, where Mary, Queen of Scots,
lived, and where her son, James VI. of Scotland,
was born. It was James VI. of Scotland
who afterward became James I. of England,
and thus, for the first time, Scotland and England
were united under one crown. Later the
two countries were called The United Kingdom
of Great Britain, and thus they have
remained ever since.</p>

<p>However, in manners and customs, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
many details of their daily life, the peoples of
the two nations are still very different. A
Scotsman is very proud of being a Scotsman,
and he does not like it a bit if you call him an
Englishman.</p>

<p>Donald always took great pains to explain
to his young English cousins, when they came
to visit him, that Scotland had given a king to
England, instead of England sending a king
to rule over the Scotch.</p>

<p>"King Edward is Edward VII. of England,
but he is Edward I. of Scotland, because we
never had another king by the name of Edward
before him; is it not so, father?" asked
Donald, earnestly.</p>

<p>"All the same, I don't know any one who
cheered louder than you, Don," said Sandy,
"when King Edward came here to review the
Scottish Volunteers last autumn."</p>

<p>"Of course, he is our king, and I like him
very much," said Don, with dignity; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
made them all laugh, and Janet said King
Edward would feel complimented.</p>

<p>The doctor showed them where they could
look over the parapet, and see how steep and
straight was the wall of rock on which the
castle stood; and pointed out the very steepest
side, where he and his brother Clarke once
climbed up the rock from the bottom to the
top, when they were boys. "And a stiff climb
it was, my lads," continued the doctor; "you
need not be putting your heads together, and
planning to do the same. It was a foolhardy
thing to have done."</p>

<p>The children were always greatly interested
in the "Dogs' Cemetery," where are buried
all the dogs of the regiment, and each time
they came to the castle they always looked
to see if there was another little grave,
though, as Doctor Gordon said, they could
not expect dogs to die off so quickly as all
that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are we going now, uncle?" said
Janet, slipping her hand into the doctor's.</p>

<p>"How would you like to see Holyrood
Palace, where Queen Mary lived?" he asked,
as he led the little band down the Cannon-gate,
the old winding street which leads down
the hill from the castle, through the heart
of the old town, to Holyrood Palace.</p>

<p>"Great things have happened on this narrow
street, and many great people of Scotland have
lived here," said the doctor, pointing to the
tall old buildings, so close together that hardly
any daylight gets between them, set back, as
they are, in narrow courtyards and alleyways
called "closes" and "wynds." On one side
is the house where John Knox, the great
religious reformer, lived.</p>

<p>"Do you see a heart carved on that stone
yonder?" said Doctor Gordon, as he pointed
out a stone in the pavement. "That marks the
spot where once stood the old 'Tolbooth.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of which Sir Walter Scott wrote in 'The
Heart of Midlothian,'" broke in Donald,
anxious to show his knowledge. "Father
has read several of Scott's novels to me;
they are splendid stories,&mdash;all about the
old days in Scotland."</p>

<p>"And of other countries as well, Donald,"
said his father.</p>

<p>"When you children are older, you will
enjoy reading for yourselves Sir Walter Scott's
'Waverley Novels.' Scott was a splendid
story-teller, and his books are famous and
read the world over. And this reminds me,"
continued the good-natured doctor, "that perhaps
you young people would like to see
Abbotsford, where the great Scotch author
lived; and Melrose Abbey, which he loved
so well."</p>

<p>"No need to ask," he laughed, as the children
gathered about him, with delighted oh's
and ah's!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I had half-promised Don that I
would take him there this autumn. Perhaps
we can persuade your father and mother to
spare you girls another week, and we will all
go together. Eh! what do you think?"
and the doctor playfully pulled Marjorie's
tam.</p>

<p>The children were so excited over this that
they were in front of Holyrood Palace before
they knew it.</p>

<p>Of course, the first part they visited were
the rooms where once lived the beautiful
Mary, Queen of Scots, who was beheaded
by the order of her cousin Elizabeth, then
Queen of England.</p>

<p>Queen Mary had many faults, no doubt;
but surely she did not merit such a cruel
death.</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange what wee bits of rooms
kings and queens lived in? Why, this bedroom
is not nearly so large as our room at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
home, and the little room out of it, which she
used as a sitting-room, is hardly large enough
for a doll," said Marjorie.</p>

<p>For a fact, they did seem small for a great
queen. There was the very bed she had slept
on and other furniture of her time. The children
peered down the narrow stairs up which
had stolen the murderers of poor Rizzio, the
queen's faithful friend.</p>

<p>"I should not have liked to have lived in
Queen Mary's time," said Janet, shaking her
head, and the little girls shuddered when the
guide pointed out what are said to be the
blood-stains of Rizzio.</p>

<p>The girls would not go near the place, but
Don and Sandy went boldly up, and declared
that they saw the stains; but it is just possible
that their imaginations helped them out a little,
for it was many hundreds of years ago that all
this happened, and, besides, it is too dark in
that particular corner behind the door to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
anything. Some day when you are older you
will read about Queen Mary and her sad
fate.</p>

<p>Afterward the little party went into the
great hall of the palace, where are hung the
portraits of all the Scottish kings. They all
look alike, having been painted by some bold
artist from imagination; which seems a strange
thing to have done, does it not? Don said he
could paint as good pictures himself.</p>

<p>Again Doctor Gordon led his little tourists
up through the "old town," and this time
they saw the great school of medicine of the
University of Edinburgh, where Donald's
father and uncle had taken their degrees to
become Doctors of Medicine.</p>

<p>This great school stands higher in rank,
perhaps, than any other similar school in the
world, and many distinguished men have graduated
from it.</p>

<p>"I am going to study there, too, some day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
like father and Uncle Clarke, and be a great
doctor," said Don.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to be a piper
a little while ago," laughed Sandy. "And it
was a 'herd' you were going to be just the
other day," echoed Marjorie.</p>

<p>"I don't care," retorted Don, stoutly, "I
am going to do something great, anyway."</p>

<p>"That's the right spirit, my son; whatever
you do, do it well," said his father, patting him
on the shoulder. The children laughed, but
his father was very pleased.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ANOTHER WALK IN EDINBURGH AND A VISIT
TO ABBOTSFORD</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> lassies are going with me to do a
bit of shopping in Princes Street," said Mrs.
Gordon, as they all sat around the breakfast-table
one morning.</p>

<p>"We want to buy a present for mother's
birthday while we are here. It is week after
next, you know," said Janet.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you want to go with us,
Don; lads don't like to buy things," she
added, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, if you are only going after
trinkets, I wouldn't give a 'bawbee' for that
kind of fun. Now, if you were really going
to <em>see</em> things, that might be different," said
Donald, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have not seen the 'Dog's Monument,'
and lots of things yet," he continued,
thinking it a little beneath his dignity to go
shopping, but in his heart really wishing to
go, if only he were begged hard enough.</p>

<p>"No one can tell the story of the faithful
dog better than Don, so you lassies ought to
get him to show you his grave and that of
his master," said the doctor, who saw Don's
trouble, and was ready to help him out.</p>

<p>Of course this made the little girls wild
to hear all about it, so Don had to promise
to go with them and show them the spot.</p>

<p>It did not take long to reach Princes Street,
which the Scotch people think the finest street
in the world. It is a splendid broad thoroughfare;
on one side are the beautiful "Gardens,"
with flowers, statues, and walks, while rising
high above is the old castle on its height. On
the other side of the street are the great shops
and hotels. The shops are full of pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Scotch things. There you may see all the
different kinds of "Clan" tartans, and there
are a great many of them. There also are
heaps of "cairngorms" and purple amethysts,
which is another precious stone found in Scotland,
and is almost as much of a favourite as
the "cairngorms." Both of these stones were
much used to ornament the ancient Scotch
swords and daggers, and were often set into
brooches used to fasten the tartans, as you see
in the piper's picture.</p>

<p>The jewellers now make them up into all
kinds of souvenirs of Scotland; little claymores
and daggers for pins, and copies of
old-time brooches, and all kinds of quaint
things.</p>

<p>"Well, dearies, what do you think your
mother would like?" asked Mrs. Gordon,
as they passed by the gay shops.</p>

<p>There were so many beautiful things to
choose from it was difficult for the little girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to make up their minds. At last Mrs.
Gordon said a brooch would make a pretty
present, which pleased Marjorie, who was so
fond of pretty things to wear.</p>

<p>Janet was in favour of a gold pen. So at
last it was agreed that Marjorie should buy
the brooch with an amethyst set in it, and
Janet should get a pretty pen with a cairngorm
set in the handle. Don by this time
was as much interested in "shopping" as the
girls, and bought a pretty blotter, with the
handle made of Scotch pebbles, for his aunt.
So everybody was highly pleased, and most
of all was Mrs. Lindsay, when she received
her presents.</p>

<p>After this, Mrs. Gordon bought them all
some "Edinburgh Rock," which is a nice,
creamy candy, that isn't a bit like a rock, but
which just melts in one's mouth.</p>

<p>Then they all climbed to the top of
the Scott Monument, which stands in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Princes Street Gardens, from which place they
had a fine view of the beautiful city of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Don now led the way to the memorial which
was put up to the faithful little dog called
"Grey Friars Bobby." "This is his story,"
said Don: "When his master died, and was
buried in Grey Friars churchyard, the poor
little dog was so broken-hearted that for twelve
years he never left his master's grave except at
night, when the caretaker of the cemetery took
him into his house and fed him. As soon as
the door was opened each morning, he would
run to his master's grave and stay there until
he was taken in again at night. One day the
caretaker went for him as usual, and found him
lying dead, stretched across the grave. He was
buried in the same grave with his master, to
whom he had been so faithful."</p>

<p>The monument, in the street without, is in
the form of a drinking-fountain, with a statue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of the little dog on the top. It was put up so
that the story might not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Don pointed out the grave to the little girls,
through the railing of the churchyard, and then
Mrs. Gordon said they must hurry home, for
it was late, and the doctor would think they
were lost.</p>

<p>Janet and Marjorie had received permission
to remain away from home another week for
the visit to Abbotsford, Sir Walter Scott's old
home, so one day soon after the young people
boarded the train bound for Abbotsford.</p>

<p>"We are now not far from the English
boundary-line, or 'Border,' as the Scotch call
it," said Doctor Gordon, as they approached
Melrose, the station at which they were to
alight.</p>

<p>This "Border" land was the scene of countless
fights and feuds between the Scotch and
English in the old days when the two nations
were enemies. The English would dash across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the Border, seize the sheep and cattle belonging
to the Scotch, burn their homes, and then
quickly escape to their own territory.</p>

<p>Then the Scotch would take a turn at the
same game, and so it went on for ages. Because
of this warfare the Border had to be
strongly fortified on each side, and many
ruins of these old castles and watch-towers
are yet to be seen in these parts.</p>

<p>Much has been written by Scottish authors
and poets about the daring deeds of the Border
Clans of that time.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott could claim relationship
with most of the Border Clans, and was very
proud of it, and many of the most romantic
tales and daring deeds of which he has written
dealt with these same Clansmen.</p>

<p>"This is Melrose, now," said the doctor,
looking out of the window.</p>

<p>So it was, and the young people lost no
time in gathering up their belongings, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a few minutes they were standing before Melrose
Abbey.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/i077.jpg" width="331" height="500" alt="Abbey in background; three children in foreground" />
<div class="caption">MELROSE ABBEY</div>
</div>

<p>Formerly this famous abbey was a large
establishment where lived many monks, presided
over by an abbot. What one sees at
Melrose to-day, however, is only the church
of the great institution. The rest of the buildings
have disappeared with time, for it is over
five hundred years since the last of its stones
were laid.</p>

<p>The caretaker unlocked a small door, and
they entered what centuries before had been
the beautiful abbey church, but was now a
ruin, though still so beautiful as to be the
marvel of all who see it. It was here that
Sir Walter often came, and Doctor Gordon
showed the children the stone which was the
great man's favourite seat.</p>

<p>After a walk through the old churchyard,
they strolled around the little town of Melrose.
In the High Street stands a very old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
memorial cross. Many of the old Scottish
towns (and English ones, too, for that matter)
have these old stone crosses, usually set in the
middle of the main street, or in the public
square.</p>

<p>After eating their dinner at one of the old-fashioned
inns of the town, Doctor Gordon
stowed his small tourists away in a carriage,
and off they went for Abbotsford, chattering
most gaily; for while the Scotch people are
often very shy and quiet among strangers,
they are as lively as possible among themselves.</p>

<p>"Over there, not far away, is Kelso," said
Doctor Gordon, pointing over the rolling hills.
"It has been called the most beautiful town in
Scotland, but you know we Scots all think our
own town the handsomest. Eh, lassies?"
laughed the doctor.</p>

<p>"There is Abbotsford now," said Mrs.
Gordon, and the children looked eagerly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the big stone house and the "silvery Tweed"
which flows by its gardens and lawns.</p>

<p>The place is still the property of a member
of the Scott family.</p>

<p>Our little party were shown many of the
rooms where the great author lived and wrote,
and they also saw many curious and beautiful
things, for Sir Walter loved to collect relics of
his country. Don was greatly interested in the
sword and other belongings of the <em>real</em> Rob
Roy, and the picture of Scott's favourite dog,
for he was a great lover of dogs.</p>

<p>But time was short, and so our travellers
had to hurry away, for they were to take a
drive to Dryburgh Abbey, situated a few miles
away.</p>

<p>This is another old ruined abbey. It is
here that Sir Walter Scott is buried. There
are only a few walls of the abbey still standing,
and where the old abbey church formerly stood
is now a garden set about with walks and trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
In one of the ruined aisles of the church which
stands in one corner of this garden can be seen
the tomb of Scott and the other members of
his family.</p>

<p>The children went back to Edinburgh tired,
but happy, after a day which they will never
forget.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a great bustle and running about
at the Gordon house one morning. Doctor
and Mrs. Gordon, Don, and Sandy were leaving
for their visit to Skylemore, Uncle Alan's
home in the Highlands.</p>

<p>Don was torn between the delight of going,
and the sorrow at having to leave "Rob Roy"
behind. He had begged to be allowed to take
him, but it was decided that "Rob" was too
young to travel, and Sandy's mother promised
to take care of him. So that the only thing
that marred Don's pleasure was the last look
of "doggie," whining sadly in Mrs. MacPherson's
arms, as the carriage drove away.</p>

<p>But even "Rob Roy" was forgotten for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
moment, when they all stood on the platform
of the great Waverley Station. There were
crowds of people about, all bound for the
country. Hunting parties, with their guns
and dogs, were everywhere; for the autumn
is the season for shooting grouse over the
Scotch moors. Everybody was greatly excited,
the dogs as much as anybody. Sandy
said that they seemed to know that they were
going off for a good time, too.</p>

<p>"Take your places, children," said the
doctor, as he bundled them into their compartment
in the train.</p>

<p>It was a fine autumn day, and there are not
too many such days in Scotland; for it is a
rainy little country, and hardly a day passes
without some rain falling. Not heavy rains,
as in our country, but a soft, misty drizzle
which nobody seems to mind in the least.
There would be no use in staying indoors, for
this is the way it is most of the time. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Scotch people dress for bad weather. They
are fond of having their clothes made of the
thick tweed and cheviot cloths, which, as
their names show, are made in Scotland, for
the Tweed is a Scotch river, and the Cheviot
Hills are on the border between England and
Scotland.</p>

<p>Donald and Sandy wore jackets made of
the celebrated "Harris tweeds," which have
a queer smoky smell which comes from their
being made in the crofters' cottages on the
island of Harris, off the north coast of Scotland.
The "crofters" are those who live in
tiny houses built of rough stone, and their
principal occupation and industry is the weaving
of this coarse cloth, from wool, by hand,
as they sit before their peat fires. For this
reason the genuine Harris tweed always smells
smoky.</p>

<p>"Sandy, what on earth have you got
in that bundle that you have been carrying so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
carefully ever since we left home?" asked
Donald.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Sandy, giving him a violent
kick.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to put your package in
the luggage-rack?" said Doctor Gordon,
looking over the top of his morning paper.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, sir," said Sandy, growing
very red, "it's no trouble to carry."</p>

<p>"I do believe there is something moving
about in it," cried Donald, getting more curious
and moving nearer. Another kick came
from Sandy. But just then the train began
to cross the great Firth of Forth bridge, and
everything else was forgotten as they all put
their heads out to see this wonderful bridge,
nearly a mile and a half long.</p>

<p>"Can't you see a castle yonder?" said Doctor
Gordon, presently. The boys were on the
lookout, and Don soon spied it on its high
hill rising above the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is Stirling Castle, and next to Edinburgh
Castle it is probably the most famous
in Scotland," said Doctor Gordon. "Many
stirring deeds and brave battles have taken
place there in the past."</p>

<p>"Castles were always built on high hills,
were they not?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"Yes, so that they could be more easily protected,
and also that a watch could be kept
over many miles of country, in order to guard
against any surprise by an enemy.</p>

<p>"Over yonder lies the Field of Bannockburn,
where was fought one of the greatest
battles in the history of Scotland, when Robert
Bruce defeated the English, and broke their
power in Scotland."</p>

<p>Doctor Gordon pointed out many other
historic spots as they were whirled along.
Soon the scenery became more wild and
beautiful; and they passed lovely rolling hills
covered with purple heather, forests, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
background of distant mountains. In a few
minutes the train was drawing in to Skylemore
Station.</p>

<p>"There's the break now," shouted Don,
"and Andy Maclose driving; and there's
Uncle Alan and the lassies."</p>

<p>Such a welcome as they all got! Then
everybody packed themselves into the big
break, or carryall, and the trunks and bags
were all piled into a cart, all except Sandy's
parcel, which he stoutly refused to part with
for a moment.</p>

<p>Then they drove off, everybody trying to
talk at the same time. The young people
were full of the birthday party which was to
be the next day.</p>

<p>A drive of a few miles brought them to
Skylemore, where Aunt Jessie was waiting
for them at the door, and soon they were
enjoying a good tea around a blazing fire
in the big hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning the birthday celebration
began at the breakfast-table, where all of Marjorie's
presents were spread out around her
plate. Marjorie herself was so excited that
she could hardly open the parcels, and Mrs.
Lindsay had to help her.</p>

<p>There was a nice writing-desk from her
father, and a silver inkstand from her mother;
a pretty pen-holder from her aunt, and a pearl
pin from her uncle. Donald had brought her
a dear little silver bracelet, engraved with the
words "Dinna forget."</p>

<p>"Why, this is the package that Sandy
brought with him," said Donald, after all
the others had been opened and examined;
"it was for Marjorie all the time."</p>

<p>So it was, and when Marjorie opened it
what do you suppose gravely walked out?
Sandy's one, little, fluffy "tewky" that he
was so proud of! Such a shout of laughter
as went up from everybody! Marjorie was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
delighted, for she had so often admired Sandy's
pet, and its accomplishments.</p>

<p>"To think, Sandy, that you brought it all
the way, and never told us what you had,"
said Don, as soon as he could speak for
laughing. "I did hear something 'cheep,'
though."</p>

<p>After Marjorie had thanked everybody for
her presents the merry crowd of young people
finished their breakfasts, put the "tewky" in
a basket with something to eat, and all went
out for a walk.</p>

<p>First they went down through the little
village of Skylemore, where the village people
gave the children a hearty greeting and asked
after the "Laird," as they called Mr. Lindsay,
which is the way the country-folk always speak
of the owner of a large estate.</p>

<p>The little girls were great favourites in the
village, and Marjorie stopped to tell everybody
about her presents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's go up on the moor and around by
Allan Water," said Janet. So they climbed
up over the hills, hiding from each other in
the deep purple heather, and playing that they
were lost.</p>

<p>"There's 'Auld Wullie,' the 'herd,'" suddenly
called out Donald. "Herd" with the
Scotch means a shepherd. And sure enough
there was "Auld Wullie" sitting on a rock
wrapped in his plaid,&mdash;a small black and
white check,&mdash;which is the kind generally
worn by the shepherds, and has so come to
be known as "shepherd's plaid."</p>

<p>Around him were his sheep, which were
carefully watched by three fine collie dogs,
who marched around the flock, and kept them
in order, as an officer does his soldiers. "Auld
Wullie" was a great friend of the children,
who never tired of hearing his tales of sheep-dogs
and shepherds, and their lonely lives on
the moors and hillsides. "Auld Wullie" was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a descendant of an old Highland shepherd
family, who always among themselves spoke
the old Gaelic tongue, and it was great fun
for the children to get him to address them
in the tongue of his forefathers. Gaelic is
even yet much spoken in the north of Scotland.</p>

<p>One of "Auld Wullie's" great stories was
how Dindie, his old collie, had won the prize
at a sheep-dogs' contest. These matches are
held in different parts of Scotland, and the dog
who can handle his sheep the best wins
the prize. It is a great event in the particular
neighbourhood where the contest is
held, and only the best trained dogs are entered.</p>

<p>"An' it's the lassie's birthday. Ay, but
she's a braw lassie now," said the herd, as
they tramped over to his cottage not far
away.</p>

<p>It was a tiny cottage of rough stones, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a roof also made of flat stones, and a large
enclosure at the back for the sheep. There
were only two rooms, but "Auld Wullie"
asked them into the front one, which the
country people call the "ben room," and for
a moment went himself into the back one,
which they call the "but room." Presently
he came back with something in his hand, and
as the party left the little house, he turned to
Marjorie, and said: "Just a wee giftie for the
lassie," and, to her surprise, put into her hands
a number of Scotch pebbles.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/i093.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Shepherd handing gift to girl" />
<div class="caption">"'JUST A WEE GIFTIE FOR THE LASSIE.'"</div>
</div>

<p>These pebbles, which are all sorts of bright
colours, are found in the clear mountain
streams, and are set in all kinds of trinkets,&mdash;brooches,
pins, and the like,&mdash;and sold as
souvenirs of bonnie Scotland. The old man
had gathered them in his lonely walks over
the hills, and you can imagine how pleased
Marjorie was.</p>

<p>As it was getting near dinner-time our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
young people said good-bye to "Auld
Wullie" and the collies, and set out for
home as quickly as they could.</p>

<p>The afternoon was spent in getting ready
for the party which was to be held in the
evening. It was to be a fancy-dress affair,
and there was much flying around with excitement,
you may believe, before everything was
arranged.</p>

<p>Marjorie was dressed to represent a bluebell
in a blue dress trimmed with bluebells
and a little blue cap on her head shaped like
one of these flowers. Janet was heather. Her
dress was pale pink, with garlands of real
heather bloom, and a wreath of heather on
her head. These two flowers are great favourites
in Scotland.</p>

<p>Don was gotten up as "Rob Roy," dressed
in the Macgregor tartan, which his uncle had
loaned him, with a fierce-looking skean-dhu
stuck in his stocking, and a great claymore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
hanging by his side, which got in his way
most of the time.</p>

<p>Sandy tried to look kingly, like Robert
Bruce, with a gold-paper crown on his head.
Altogether they made a very splendid
showing.</p>

<p>The children had barely time to exhibit
themselves before the company began to
come, a number of their little neighbours
from roundabout.</p>

<p>They all played games. Aunt Mary started
them off with "Merry Metanzie," which is
played with a handkerchief while singing a
song, much after the style of "Dropping the
Handkerchief."</p>

<p>Another favourite game is "Scotch and
English." Two sides are formed, each lining
up opposite the other, and an attempt is made
to capture any opponent who puts his foot
over the imaginary border. This, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
may suppose, is a game which usually ends in
a great romp.</p>

<p>After this they all went in to a fine supper,
with a big cake in front of Marjorie's plate,
with ten candles stuck in it, all alight, one for
each year of her age. After the young folks
had eaten much more than was good for them,
there was dancing, and somebody said: "Let's
have a 'Sword Dance,' and a real 'Highland
Fling.'" So nothing would do but that they
should get a "<i>gillie</i>" who would dance the
"Sword Dance," across two crossed sword-blades,
with much agility and apparently
much risk to his person.</p>

<p>Everybody gathered in the big hall, and
presently in came old Dugald with his bagpipes,
while behind him walked a splendid
looking fellow, dressed in his tartan, who
went through the difficult steps of his dances
in a way that won the applause of every
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay took down from the wall two
old swords and laid them crossed at right
angles on the floor, when the dancer pranced
in and out and between their sharp edges
without ever touching them, which is a great
feat.</p>

<p>How everybody applauded! Then old
Dugald struck up his pipes again, and everybody
sang the old Scotch song, "The Bluebells
of Scotland," in honour of Marjorie.
After this everybody took partners and danced
the reel, what we call the "Virginia Reel," up
and down the big hall. In the midst of it all
in walked the little "<i>tewky</i>," Sandy's gift to
Marjorie. Where he came from nobody
seemed to know; but probably he was lonesome,
and being so friendly thought he would
like to join the company.</p>

<p>This broke up the dancing pretty effectually,
everybody was laughing so. Don tripped over
his claymore and fell against Sandy, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Sandy's gilt crown went rolling down the
hall. But this only added to the fun, and it
was a tired but happy lot of young people that
Mrs. Lindsay bundled off to bed, at a very
late hour for Scotch children.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SOME SCOTCH CUSTOMS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> little Scotch cousins do not make so
much of Christmas as the American children.
Their great holiday is the New Year. On the
eve of "Hogmanay," as it is called, everybody
stays up to welcome the New Year, with great
jollification.</p>

<p>"Do you think that Uncle Clarke will get
here in time?" Don asked for the hundredth
time on New Year's eve. The Gordons had
been expecting him all the week, but he had
not yet come, and Don went about grumbling
that "Hogmanay" would be no fun at all
without Uncle Clarke.</p>

<p>The MacPhersons and the Gordons were
all sitting in the library of Kelvin House, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
see the old year out and the new year in. A
table was spread with cakes and many other
good things to eat, and the children had been
wondering all the evening who would make
the "first-footing."</p>

<p>A "first-footing" is made by the first person
who enters the house after the stroke of midnight;
and if he wishes well to the household,
he should bring a cake of shortbread with him.</p>

<p>There is always great hilarity at a "first-footing."
Everybody kept their eyes on the
clock, and Doctor Gordon pulled out his
watch every little while to be sure that the
clock had not stopped.</p>

<p>Just as the stroke of twelve rang out, all
the bells of the city began to ring, and great
shouts went up from the throngs of people
who crowded the streets, and there was a
great kissing and shaking of hands among the
happy households who had assembled for the
ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of all the gaiety at Kelvin
House the front door-bell rang. "Oh! there's
our 'first-footing,'" shouted the children in
one voice, and they all rushed to the door.
Who should it be but Uncle Clarke, with a big
cake of shortbread in his arms!</p>

<p>"I knew he'd come, I knew he'd come,"
shouted Don, triumphantly, dragging him into
the room. Well, wasn't there a great time!
and wasn't everybody pleased!</p>

<p>After this other friends came in to wish the
family a "Happy New Year," and then everybody
joined hands and sang "Auld Lang
Syne," that best known song of Robert
Burns, Scotland's greatest poet.</p>

<p>
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And never brought to mind?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We'll drink a cup of kindness yet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For the days of Auld Lang Syne."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Another great event for the children of
Scotland is to hear a "Royal Proclamation,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
which is a message from the king, read out at
Mercat Cross in Edinburgh. It is carried out
with great ceremony, and is another old-time
custom which has lived to this day. The
heralds come in their gorgeous costumes,
all red and blue and gold, with a military
escort from the Highland Regiment at the
castle, and the band plays as the procession
makes its way to the cross.</p>

<p>There is a great fanfare by the trumpeters,
after which the king's message is read out
to the people assembled. Then there is another
fanfare blown on the long trumpets,
which have gorgeous banners hanging from
them, after which the band plays "God Save
the King," and the people all take off their hats.</p>

<p>One morning a shrill whistle brought Sandy
to his garden wall.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he called out.</p>

<p>"Whist!" It was Don who swung himself
off an overhanging branch of an old pear-tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and dropped down on Sandy's side of the
wall.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of the Irish lads behind
the churchyard wall; they didn't see me, so
I sneaked around the back way. Our crowd
is going to be at the top of the street, so hurry
up," said Don, in a most excited manner.</p>

<p>"I'm ready," said Sandy, "but we haven't
got a bit of blue."</p>

<p>"Here's a ribbon that will do; I saved it
off the last box of sweets," said Don, with the
air of a general planning a campaign, as he
took a bedraggled bit of blue ribbon out of
his pocket and hastily cut it in two with his
knife.</p>

<p>Each of the lads tied a piece in his button-hole
as they ran out by all the back alleyways
in the direction of the church.</p>

<p>What was it all about? Well, it was St. Patrick's
Day, the seventeenth of March, and
when any of the Scotch and Irish lads met on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that day, there was bound to be a battle between
them. The Irish boys wore green ribbons,
and the Scotch boys blue ones.</p>

<p>This is one of the many old customs which
still go on in some parts, though probably not
many know just why it has survived; and the
boys themselves perhaps never stop to realize
that it is an old custom, and do not care what
its origin may have been, so long as it furnishes
them some fun and no serious hurts
come of it. On one occasion Don came home
after the fray with a big bump on the side of
his head which had frightened his mother, but
at which the doctor laughed, and said a few
knocks like that wouldn't hurt any lad. As
for Donald, he gloried in going around and
showing off his injury, his head meanwhile
wrapped in a great poultice. For this he was
quite a hero in the eyes of his playmates.</p>

<p>To-day the Scotch line of battle was preparing
to move from its position when our lads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
came up panting and breathless. The idea
was to surprise the Irish boys entrenched
behind the churchyard wall, who were guarding
themselves only against an attack which
they expected to come from an entirely different
direction.</p>

<p>Our little Scotch band crept carefully along,
taking advantage of the shelter of every wall
and tree. They had drawn up in the rear of
the enemy, and were just gathering their forces
for an onslaught, when a head popped round
the angle of the wall, and out rushed the whole
troop of Irish lads, and the battle begun.</p>

<p>First one crowd was driven down the hill
and then the other; and so it went on until
from sheer fatigue both sides drew off, each
claiming a victory; which probably was as
good a way of deciding it as any, for it is very
hard to say which are the bravest, the Scotch
or the Irish. Both nations have proved themselves
fair fighters in the past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day Sandy and Don were seen
playing games with some of the enemy, so
it is seen no hard feelings came from the
encounter.</p>

<p>Donald and Sandy always enjoyed the fun
of egg-rolling at Easter, which is much the
same kind of sport that children amuse themselves
with in some parts of America, though
nobody seems to know just how the custom
originated.</p>

<p>Then the children have "Hallowe'en" parties,
when they play many kinds of queer
games. Often there is a cake in which there
has been baked a small china doll, a brass ring,
a thimble, a button, and a threepenny silver
piece, each of which means some sort of
good or bad fortune for the one who finds
it in his or her piece of cake. But, generally
speaking, the children are most anxious to
receive the coin, for that can be spent, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>We must not forget the "haggis," which
Donald sometimes ate for dinner. It is a
favourite old-time Scotch dish, a sort of a pudding,
made of various kinds of meat and meal,
and put into a bag and boiled a long time. It
is not eaten so much to-day as formerly, but
Mrs. Gordon always made a point of having
it on certain special occasions, as a great treat.
As it is very rich, and quite unsuited as a
steady diet for children, perhaps it is just as
well that they do not have it too often.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SUMMER HOLIDAYS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the beginning of the summer holidays,
and the Gordons, with Sandy, had come
to Skylemore that the young people might
spend their holidays together.</p>

<p>Many pleasant trips had been planned, and
the first was to be a picnic on Loch Katrine,
which was not far from Skylemore.</p>

<p>It was early on a bright summer's morning
when Dugald, with his four prancing horses,
appeared at the door, and the two Clans of
Gordons and Lindsays, to say nothing of
Sandy, who was a MacPherson, piled into
the big break, along with many baskets full
of good things.</p>

<p>With a waving of caps and handkerchiefs
off they went, and soon they were driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
along the beautiful mountain glens and
through the Trossachs, which means literally
a wooded gorge or ravine.</p>

<p>"There is the loch now," cried Don,
presently.</p>

<p>"No, that is Loch Achray," said his uncle,
"and that mountain is Ben Venue, but we
shall see Loch Katrine very soon;" and it
was not long before Dugald drew up on the
very edge of the loch itself, and a camping-place
was soon found under the trees and in
sight of Ellen's Isle.</p>

<p>Rugs were brought from the break and
spread on the ground around a big rock which
was to serve as a table. Everybody helped
to unpack the big baskets, for all were as
hungry as if they had had no breakfasts.</p>

<p>Not much was said for a time but "Please
pass that," and "Please pass this," and "Isn't
this good?" until finally even the boys decided
they had eaten enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa, tell us about Ellen's Isle," said
Janet, as they all sat around after lunch, and
tried to see who could throw a stone the
farthest into the water.</p>

<p>So Mr. Lindsay told them the story of the
"fair Ellen," whom Sir Walter Scott wrote
of in his great poem called "The Lady of
the Lake." Ellen was called "the lady of the
lake," and lived with her father on the little
island yonder. Then Mr. Lindsay told them
of "Roderick Dhu," and of the gatherings of
the Clan Alpine which took place in the old
days in a glen not far away, and how at a
signal armed men wrapped in their plaids
would spring up out of the seemingly lonely
dells and glens as if by magic.</p>

<p>Those were wild days in Scotland long ago,
days of fierce fights and brave deeds, when
Clans met and rushed into battle with a wild
"slogan," as their battle-cry was known.</p>

<p>"Sandy says that he does not believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
'Rob Roy' was a real person; but he was,
and lived right here, didn't he, Uncle Alan?"
said Don, eagerly, in defence of his hero.</p>

<p>"Indeed he did, and you would like to see
his old home, wouldn't you, Don?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I!" said Don, and his eyes
shone.</p>

<p>"Well, we will go there sometime; it is
now a sheep-farm, but was once the old home
of the Macgregors. In 'Rob Roy's' time
bands of lawless men came down from the
north to steal cattle and do other kinds of
mischief. So the 'lairds' in these parts paid
'Rob Roy' and his little band of followers to
protect their property from these invaders and
robbers. In after days the band was formed
into a regiment called the 'Black Watch,'
which to-day is one of the most famous of
the Scotch regiments."</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott has done much to make
this part of Scotland well known, and people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
come from all over the world, and especially
from America, anxious to see the beautiful
country of rocks and glens and heather-clad
mountains of which he wrote in his famous
novels and poems.</p>

<p>From the telling of stories our Clansmen
soon turned to singing songs, for the Scotch
are full of sentiment, and are very fond of
music. Some of the most beautiful of our
popular songs have come from Scotland.
There is one which is known the world over,
and sung as often by little American cousins
as by little Scotch cousins; and that is "Annie
Laurie."</p>

<p>So when Aunt Jessie began to sing "Annie
Laurie," all joined in with a will, and sang
one of the sweetest songs the world has ever
known:</p>

<p>
"They sang of love and not of fame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Forgot was Scotland's glory.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Each heart recalled a different name,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But all sang 'Annie Laurie.'"</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>After this there was a general scramble to
get the things picked up. The whole party
mounted again to their seats in the break, and
Dugald made the four horses just fly for
home; though they did not need much urging,
as every horse seems to know when his
head is turned homeward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Is that Robert Burns's house?" said
Janet, in a disappointed voice.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/i115.jpg" width="330" height="500" alt="group of people looking at small house" />
<div class="caption">"OUR LITTLE SCOTCH FRIENDS WERE STANDING BEFORE
THE LITTLE HOUSE AT AYR, WHERE ROBERT BURNS
WAS BORN."</div>
</div>

<p>"Yes, my dear," said her father, "great
men have often been brought up in small
houses like this. Bobby Burns was only a
ploughboy, but he became a great poet, one
of the greatest in the world."</p>

<p>Our little Scotch friends were standing
before the little house at Ayr, where Robert
Burns was born. They had come down from
Glasgow for the day to visit that part of Scotland
made famous by the poet. It is hard to
say of whom the Scotch people are most fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and proud, Scott or Burns. The young people
had looked forward with a great deal of
pleasure to this visit, and they all felt pretty
much as Janet did.</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> a tiny house, what the country people
call a "clay biggin," with a thatched roof. Inside
are many relics of Burns, but the children
were, perhaps, more interested in "Alloway's
Auld Haunted Kirk." This is the small church
of which Burns wrote in his poem, called
"Tam-o'-shanter," where Tam saw the witches
dance, and from whence he started on his wild
ride, with the witches after him riding on broomsticks.
It is one of the chief attractions for
visitors.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is a creepy poem," said Don; and
you will all think so, too, when you have
read it.</p>

<p>They saw the "Auld Brig of Ayr," which
means the old bridge, across the river Ayr,
and they walked along the "Banks and Braes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
o' Bonnie Doon," of which Burns wrote and
which he loved so well. They visited the
monument to Burns. Marjorie remarked that
it was not a very grand monument, not nearly
so grand as that to Scott in Edinburgh; and
she was quite right.</p>

<p>"Not far from Ayr was the home of Annie
Laurie," said Mr. Lindsay, as the train speeded
them back to Glasgow.</p>

<p>"Was she a real person, father?" eagerly
exclaimed the little girls together.</p>

<p>"Indeed she was, though her eyes were black
and not blue," said Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Janet, who
liked to be exact.</p>

<p>"Because her portrait is still to be seen at
Maxwelton House, near the town of Dumfries,
where she lived," replied her father.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd rather her eyes had been blue,"
said Marjorie, and the children kept talking
about blue and black eyes until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
reached the great St. Enoch's railway station
at Glasgow.</p>

<p>There are so many delightful journeys to
be made from Glasgow by rail and steamer
that it is one of the best starting points in
all Scotland for excursions, of which all children
and most old folks are so fond. The
Lindsays and the Gordons were accordingly
to stay in Glasgow for a week, that the young
people might enjoy more of these rare treats,
and take some of the lovely sails on the river
Clyde and among the near-by islands.</p>

<p>Don and Sandy were having some hot discussions
as to which was the finest city in
Scotland,&mdash;Glasgow or Edinburgh. This
was about the only thing that the boys ever
disagreed on. Sandy's father came originally
from Glasgow, so Sandy always stood up
for it.</p>

<p>"It's a big city, and lots richer than Edinburgh;
and think of all the business that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
done here, and of the lots and lots of ships
that come and go from all parts of the world.
It's the largest city in Scotland, too, and the
second city of the kingdom," Sandy would
say.</p>

<p>"But it's not so beautiful as Edinburgh.
It hasn't anything like Princes Street, nor
so many famous old buildings and historic
places, nor our great colleges. Anybody had
rather live in Edinburgh&mdash;you know you
would, Sandy," Don would argue.</p>

<p>And the truth of it all was, both boys were
right.</p>

<p>Early one morning found our party gathered
on the steamer <i>Lord of the Isles</i> for a cruise
around the islands off the coast. They passed
the great ship-building yards of the Clyde, the
largest in the world, as they steamed down the
river. The ships built upon the Clyde have
always been famous all over the world.</p>

<p>"There is Gourock Bay, where the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
racing yachts anchor," said Mr. Lindsay. "It
was always thought to be a lucky place to set
sail. It was from this bay that many of the
yachts sailed for America when they were to
make the attempt to capture the 'America's
Cup,' that you doubtless all know about; but
while these Clyde-built boats were fine yachts,
none of them have been lucky enough to bring
back the cup."</p>

<p>Next was seen the Island of Bute and the
old Castle of Rothesay. Here they entered
a narrow bit of water, called the Kyles of Bute,
from which they entered Loch Fyne, famous
for its fresh herrings.</p>

<p>Another steamer took them through the
Crinan Canal, and thence to Oban, the capital
of the Western Highlands.</p>

<p>In this part of Scotland, called by every one
the Highlands, are the great deer forests of
many thousands of acres, belonging to some
of the great families of Scotland, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
wild deer is hunted, or "stalked," as it is
called. Here, too, are wild moors, stretching
for miles and miles, where few people live
except the shepherds who look after the
flocks.</p>

<p>There was another fine summer which was
enjoyed greatly by our little Scotch cousins,
and that was when some young American
cousins came to visit the Lindsays, and they
all went on Uncle Alan's yacht for a lovely
sail of many days, among the islands which
fringe the northern and western coasts of
Scotland. It was on this occasion that they
all went to the Isle of Skye (some of you
have probably heard of the Skye terriers),
and they stopped, too, at the Shetland Isles,
where the little horses come from. Every girl
and boy wants to own a dear little Shetland
pony.</p>

<p>Didn't they have a splendid time on this
trip! That was the time, too, when Donald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and Sandy got left behind on one of the islands
where they had all landed for a picnic,&mdash;but
that's another story!</p>

<p>So many little cousins are waiting to talk
about themselves that we must really get our
little Clan safely back home, and leave them
for the present to talk over the good times
they have had together.</p>
